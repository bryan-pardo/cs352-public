# CS 352 MACHINE PERCEPTION OF MUSIC AND AUDIO
## Northwestern University Spring 2026 

|[**Top**](#top)   |[**Calendar**](#calendar)  |[**Links**](#links) |[**Readings**](#readings)|

### Course Description
This course covers machine extraction of structure in audio files covering areas such as source separation (unmixing audio recordings into individual component sounds), sound object recognition (labeling sounds), melody tracking, beat tracking, and perceptual mapping of audio to machine-quantifiable measures.

This course is approved for the Breadth Interfaces & project requirement in the CS curriculum.

Prior programming experience sufficient to be able to do laboratory assignments in PYTHON, implementing algorithms and using libraries without being taught to do so (there is no language instruction on Python). Having taken EECS 211 and 214 would demonstrate this experience.

### Course Policies 

#### Questions outside of class
Please use [CampusWire](https://campuswire.com) for class-related questions.

#### Grading Policy
You will be graded on a 100 point scale (e.g. 93 to 100 = A, 90-92 = A-, 87-89 = B+, 83-86 = B, 80-82 = B-...and so on). 

Every assignment is worth 20 points. There are 5 assignments (including the final project). Your final grade will be the sum of midterm grade + your 4 highest assignment grades. This means you can skip any one assignment.

Homework and reading assignments are solo assignments and must be your original work. 

#### AI policy
You are expected to write your own code and write up your own answers to question. This means you. Not ChatGPT or Gemini or Copilot. This is an optional class you are (presumably) taking because you're interested. So put in the time to learn this stuff, yourself.

#### Submitting assignments
Assignments must be submitted on the due date by the time specified on Canvas. If you are worried you can't finish on time, upload a safety submission an hour early with what you have. I will grade the most recent item submitted before the deadline. Late submissions will not be graded.
